Original Ideas for Project 1 Notes
1.	Events nightlife lifestyle

7.	Yummly API; https://rapidapi.com/spoonacular/api/recipe-food-nutrition  -https://rapidapi.com/webknox/api/recipe. 
Food Recipe Application: 
1.	Text box in the middle of the page, button for recipes to show up, book a table (restaurants) near your area (drop down menu); navigation bars on the top of the page that specific type of restaurants. Search on the side that allows you to look for something specific cuisine Classes would be the third options of nearby classes, figure out if there is an API. Open table being a fourth options Special occasion option and ratings (if this possible); time option (ensure we can give live feed of time option). 
2.	So a new page after options and customize the ratings, the distance time availability, type of food. Alert for location to share it would have to be the first ask for information. 
3.	Iframe for movies is required.
